		<p> Hi my name is Aharon Bastian from the Bahamas im 20 years old. Some of my hobbies are golfing, video games and reading manga. My lifelong dream is to be a pro golfer after playing for the national team of the bahamas I just felt this something I would love to do with the rest of my life. I've played golf for seven years made three national teams and having played all over the caribbean also the Usa it just shows the beauty of the game in such a different way. So i guess you're wondering why I'm doing design and coding why not golf in college. I've always had a love for computers and the arts my entire life whether its music comic books building or paintings. So for me to be able to work on golf while also being to learn how to build and work with the software and also the graphics that make this just an amazing time in history to be alive is so cool to me. So I can't wait to dive deeper into the world of design and coding with all the things it has to offer. </p>

		<p>Hi! My name is Jonathan Miller (just Jon for short). I was born on September 2nd, 1982. I took to music in my teen years and started playing in bands and doing live shows for my hometown in Aurora, Ontario. This kickstarted my interest in media in general and I wanted an education that suited my interests. So I studied "Recorded Music Production/Audio Engineering at Trebas Institute in Toronto Ontario and graduated in 2003. I was recently laid off from my job as a media production specialist at a company called ERG Music/Multi Music Inc. I worked at that position for 10 years, but as it was in the music industry, it was dying well before I even started at it. I consider myself fortunate to have had the position for so long. </p>

		<p>Since I was laid off, I qualified for Second Career. It's a program that helps fund people who have recently lost work due to an outdated skill set. I knew I had to get a new education since music composers and audio engineering is not in very high demand lately. In 2018 I started streaming horror games on Twitch as a hobby. I was making different elements and animations for the stream with Adobe Creative Suite, I figured that Interactive Media Design was a really good fit, especially coupled with my education in audio. I am a little intimidated by the code aspect of the program, but I've done some before, and I'm looking forward to including that in my tools to create things. So now, here I am at Fanshawe, with a whole new outlook on life that was unexpected to say the least. It's been a welcome change thus far!</p>
