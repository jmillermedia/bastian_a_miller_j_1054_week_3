		<p> Hi my name is Aharon Bastian from the Bahamas im 20 years old. Some of my hobbies are golfing,video games and reading manga. My life long dream is to be a pro golfer after playing for the national team of the bahamas i just felt this something i would love to do with the rest of my life. Ive played golf for seven years made three national teams and having played all over the caribbean also the Usa it just shows the beauty of the game in such a different way. So i guess youre wondering why i'm doing design and coding why not golf in college. Ive always had a love for computers and the arts my entire life whether its music comic books building or paintings. So for me to able work on golf while also being to learn how to build and work with the softwares also the graphics that make this just a amazing time in history to be alive is so cool to me. So i cant wait to dive deeper into the world of design and coding with all the things it has to offer.  </p>
